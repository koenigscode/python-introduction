# What you'll need
- A LaTeX distribution
- pygments (for minted) installed (`pip install pygments`)

# Before creating a pull request
- make sure pdflatex creates a working PDF file
- I would appreciate if you could remove all trailing whitespace from the edited file(s) if
your editor provides a shortcut or action for that
