\section{Advanced}

    There are several advanced or rarely used statements or concepts in Python.
    I'd to cover some of them in the following sections:

    \subsection{Assert}
        The assert statement is used to debug applications.
        You can assume a condition is \mintinline{Python}{True} and if it isn't,
        an AssertError will be thrown.

    \subsection{Else}

    \subsection{Regular Expressions}

    \subsection{Decorators}
