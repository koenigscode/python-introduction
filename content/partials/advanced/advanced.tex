\section{Advanced}
    
    There are several advanced or rarely used statements or concepts in Python.
    Some of them will be featured in the following sections:

    \subsection{Assert}
        The assert statement is used to debug applications.
        You can assume a condition is \mintinline{Python}{True} and if it isn't,
        an AssertError will be thrown.

        \mypy{content/partials/advanced/assert_example.py}
        \mytext{content/partials/advanced/assert_example.out}

    \subsection{Else}

        In Python you can use \mintinline{Python}{else} along other statements beside
        \mintinline{Python}{if}.

        \begin{indentblock}

            \textbf{For \& While} \\
            An else statement after a \mintinline{Python}{for} or \mintinline{Python}{while}
            will be executed if the loop finished normally, meaning no \mintinline{Python}{break}
            occurred.

            \textbf{Try-Except} \\
            An else statement after a try-except will be executed if no error occurred within the try block.

        \end{indentblock}
