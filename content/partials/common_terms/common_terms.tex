\section{Common Terms}
    Before getting into programming and the syntax itself I'd like to explain some common terms you'll hear all over the web and maybe work with:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{CPython:}\\
            CPython is a Python interpreter, so it's an implementation of Python.
            It's the most common interpreter available.
        \item \textbf{PyPy:}\\
            Offering better performance, PyPy is an interpreter as well and often preferred over CPython when performance is important.
        \item \textbf{IPython:}\\
            IPython is an interactive Python-Shell.
        \item \textbf{Jupyter Notebook:}\\
            You can think of Jupyter Notebooks as a document storing both text cells and code cells - enabling you to describe your code and plot diagrams. This is often used for Data Science.
            You can either install Jupyter on your local machine or use cloud-hosted solutions like \href{https://colab.research.google.com/}{Google Colab}
    \end{enumerate}
