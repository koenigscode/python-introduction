\section{Working With Files}

  \subsection{Opening \& Closing Files}
  The following code is probably pretty self-explanatory:
  using the \mintinline{Python}{read()} function you get a file object
  \footnote{actually TextIOWrapper} and can then read the file's content
  - we will get more into that later.

  Also, make sure to close the file after it is no longer needed.
  
  \mypy{content/partials/working_with_files/basic_file_example.py}
  \mytext{content/partials/working_with_files/basic_file_example.out}

  As you can see, opening and closing files is quite simple and using the 
  \mintinline{Python}{with} \textbf{context manager} makes it even easier as it automatically
  closes the file at the end of it:

  \mypy{content/partials/working_with_files/with_context_manager.py}
  \mytext{content/partials/working_with_files/with_context_manager.out}
